# ðŸ“™ FastAPI Study Project

This project is being developed for learning purposes, through @dunossauro 's guide for the FastAPI Python framework, while also exploring theoretical concepts such as Triple A test pattern, web development fundamentals, ORM Database Management _etc_.

Other technologies that I'm currently learning in this project are:<br>
### Environment:
- `poetry` for managing virtual environments.
- `pyenv` for managing Python versions.
- `alembic` for managing database's versions.

### Python Frameworks and Tools:
- `pytest` for automating tests.
- `taskipy` for simplifying commands.
- `sql-alchemy` for managing the database through an ORM system.

## Dependencies

All the dependencies are appropriately declared in `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock` files, as well as the Python version found in `.python-version` file.
